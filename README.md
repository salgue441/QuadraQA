# QuadraQA: Intelligent Document Question Answering System

## Overview

QuadraQA is an intelligent question answering system that allows users to upload documents and ask natural
language questions about their content. The system uses state-of-the-art transformer models to understand documents
and provide accurate, contextually relevant answers.

## Key Features

- **Document Understanding**: process and understand various document types
- **Context-Aware QA**: find answers within the proper context, even in long documents
- **Semantic Search**: use semantic understanding to find relevant information
- **Multi-Document Support**: ask questions across multiple documents
- **Python & NextJS Interface**: flexible API with a modern web interface

## Architecture

QuadraQA uses modular architecture:

1. **Document processing**: handles document ingestion and preprocessing
2. **Embedding service**: creates semantic representations of text
3. **QA Model**: core question answering using transformer models
4. **Service layer**: orchestrates the components
5. **API Layer**: provides HTTP interface
6. **Web Frontend**: user-friendly NextJS interface

## Models

QuadraQA uses the following transformer models:

- **Question Answering**: RoBERTa fine-tuned on SQuAD 2.0
- **Embeddings**: Sentence transformers for semantic search
- **Document Understanding**: BERT-based models for document processing
